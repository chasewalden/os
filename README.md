# OS from Scratch 
> Made in x86 Assembly and C

This was an early project of mine from around mid-2012. 
I only uploaded this a year or so later to archive it, so there isn't any history.

This was my first venture into assembly code, and honestly didn't really have a clue what I was doing.
Most of what I learned came from some awesome online resources. 
I would have been completely lost without them.

The code here is only an archive of an after-school hobby project. 
It is either the result of following one of the tutorials I found, or just messing around with some ideas.
I can't _(and won't)_ guarentee:
- It is bug free
- It runs
- It compiles
- It makes any sense
